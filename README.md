# Hello, I'm Maksym Spizhovyi ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a dedicated software developer currently pursuing a diploma in Computer Information Systems at **Okanagan College**, with a focus on **Java**, **Data Structures**, **Networking**, and **Unix**. My academic journey has equipped me with the technical foundation to build scalable and efficient software solutions.

## Freelance Projects

In addition to my studies and personal growth, I have completed freelance projects for local businesses in Kelowna, contributing to their productivity and digital presence. These include:

- **[ANDORâ€™s Blinds](#):** Revamped the companyâ€™s website to improve user experience and drive online lead generation.
- **[Ruta Roots Landscaping](#):** Created an intuitive platform to streamline customer inquiries and improve service scheduling.
- **[J&R Custom Woodwork](#):** Designed and developed a modern website to showcase custom woodworking products, enhancing client engagement.

## Professional Development

With over three years of experience in **JavaScript** application development, I have advanced my frontend development skills by completing hands-on projects and courses taught by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) on **Udemy**. These experiences enabled me to master React.js and its ecosystem, including **React Router**, **Redux**, and **Redux Toolkit**, allowing me to create dynamic, user-centric interfaces. Inspired by **Robert C. Martinâ€™s (Clean Code)**, I strive to write expressive, maintainable code and excel at breaking down complex tasks into manageable components.
