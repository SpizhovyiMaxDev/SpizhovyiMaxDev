## About Me

I am a dedicated software developer currently pursuing a diploma in Computer Information Systems at **Okanagan College**, with a focus on **Java**, **Data Structures**, **Networking**, and **Unix**. My academic journey has equipped me with the technical foundation to build scalable and efficient software solutions. With over three years of experience in **JavaScript** application development, I have advanced my frontend development skills by completing hands-on projects and courses taught by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/" target="_blank">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> on **Udemy**. These experiences enabled me to master React.js and its ecosystem, including **React Router**, **Redux**, and **Redux Toolkit**, allowing me to create dynamic, user-centric interfaces. Inspired by **Robert C. Martinâ€™s (Clean Code)**, I strive to write expressive, maintainable code and excel at breaking down complex tasks into manageable components.
